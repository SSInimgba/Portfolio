# Portfolio
This repository is to showcase my progress in Data Science and Machine Learning

I had my first encounter with Data Science while carrying out research for my MSc project, you can read about it [here](https://medium.com/@s.sinimgba/when-curiosity-is-not-enough-db18b0ce1473). So I would like to document my journey and the projects I have enjoyed working on.

| Rice or Not           | Prerequisite to the classification of Nigerian rice dishes.  The rice data was scraped from Google images and had a lot of noise (non-rice images). This project goal is to clean the dataset by using a pre-trained deep convoluted  classification neural network, the FOOD-5k dataset to first separate food images from non-food images. | Image Classification, Transfer learning, Data Cleaning,  Image augmentation, Active Learning |
| Your Dog Doppleganger | This project involved identifying different breeds of dog via image classification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Image Classification, Transfer learning                                                      |

| #SexForGrades | In the wake of the popularity of the BBC [#SexForGrades](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SexForGrades&src=typed_query) documentary.  Students of different universities tweeted about similar occurrences in their universities and organizations. This project aims to identify these Universities and organizations from a slew of tweets with the #SexForGrades tag and create a map for  easy visualization of organizations that need to reform and handle these violations. | Twitter Data Scraping, Entity Extraction and Recognition, Data Visualization |
